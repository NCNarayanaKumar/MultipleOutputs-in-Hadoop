# MultipleOutputs-in-Hadoop

There may be cases where we need to partition our data based on certion condition.
Say for example, Consider this Employee data "Employee.csv"

Lets assume one condition.
We need to seperate above data based on Gender (there can be more scenarios)

Expected outcome will be files based on Gender
